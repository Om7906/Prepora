    question: "A resistor network has resistors R1 = 10 Ω and R2 = 20 Ω connected in series across a 30 V supply. What is the current flowing through the circuit?"
    options: ["1 A","1.5 A","2 A","3 A"]
    answer: "1 A"
    explanation: "For series resistors, the equivalent resistance is R1 + R2 = 30 Ω. The current is I = V/R = 30/30 = 1 A."

    question: "An ideal transformer has a primary to secondary turns ratio of 10:1. If the primary is connected to a 120 V AC source, what is the secondary voltage?"
    options: ["1200 V","12 V","60 V","10 V"]
    answer: "12 V"
    explanation: "For an ideal transformer, Vs/Vp = Ns/Np. The ratio Ns/Np = 1/10, so Vs = 120 × 1/10 = 12 V."

    question: "If the frequency of a sinusoidal signal is doubled, how does its period change?"
    options: ["It is halved","It is doubled","It becomes quadruple","It remains unchanged"]
    answer: "It is halved"
    explanation: "The period T of a sine wave is the reciprocal of its frequency f. Doubling f halves T."
