[Beginner] [Intermediate] [Advanced] [College Student] [Working Professional] [Repeater] [High-Yield] [Scenario: Syllabus/Pattern Quick Reference]

---

## Exam Pattern (2025)

| Paper   | Mode            | Sections/Subjects                        | No. of Qs | Marks | Duration | Negative Marking | Type         |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|-------|----------|------------------|--------------|
| Paper 1 | Computer Based  | General Intelligence & Reasoning<br>General Awareness<br>Mechanical Engineering | 50<br>50<br>100 | 50<br>50<br>100 | 2 hours | 0.25 per wrong | Objective (MCQ) |
| Paper 2 | Computer Based  | Mechanical Engineering (Technical)       | 100       | 300   | 2 hours  | 0.25 per wrong   | Objective (MCQ) |

- **Total:** 200 Qs (Paper 1) + 100 Qs (Paper 2)
- **Total Marks:** 200 (Paper 1) + 300 (Paper 2)
- **Language:** English & Hindi
- **Latest Trend:** Both papers are computer-based and fully objective (MCQ). Paper 2 is no longer descriptive.

## Question Types & Marking Scheme

| Paper | Type         | Marking Scheme         | Question Types         |
|-------|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 1     | Objective MCQ| +1 for correct, -0.25 for wrong | Conceptual, numerical, theory, code-based |
| 2     | Objective MCQ| +3 for correct, -0.25 for wrong | Numerical, code/table, application, theory |

- **No descriptive questions.**
- **Recent trend:** More numericals, direct code/table picks, assertion-reasoning, and practical application.

---

## Recent Changes & Trends (2024–2025)
- Both papers are **computer-based MCQ** (no descriptive).
- **Paper 2** is now also MCQ (earlier was descriptive).
- **Increased numericals** and code/table-based questions (IS codes, standard tables).
- **PYQ pattern repeats:** Many questions are direct repeats or close variants.
- **Time management critical:** 200 Qs in 2 hours (Paper 1) – speed and accuracy matter.
- **More focus on practical application, code-based, and assertion-reasoning questions.**
