    question: "Which law of thermodynamics introduces the concept of entropy?"
    options: ["First law","Second law","Third law","Zeroth law"]
    answer: "Second law"
    explanation: "The second law defines entropy and states that total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time."

    question: "The velocity ratio of a simple screw jack with a single-start thread having pitch of 10 mm and handle length of 200 mm is approximately:"
    options: ["10","40","126","200"]
    answer: "126"
    explanation: "Velocity ratio = 2π × handle length / pitch = 2π × 200 / 10 ≈ 125.6 ≈ 126."
