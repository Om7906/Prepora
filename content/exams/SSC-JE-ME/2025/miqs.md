## How to Use This MIQ Bank
- Do 10–15 MIQs/day topic‑wise; mark mistakes in an error log; revisit on Day 3/7/14.
- Mix 70% high‑yield topics (Thermo, SOM, TOM, Fluids, Production, Heat Transfer) with 30% breadth topics (Materials, Industrial, RAC, Power Plant).
- For each MIQ: solve in 2–3 minutes (MCQ tempo), then check the brief hint/answer; tag “Concept / Formula / Misread / Speed” in your log.
