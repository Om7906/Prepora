    question: "If the average of five numbers is 20 and four of them are 18, 22, 16 and 24, what is the fifth number?"
    options: ["20", "18", "22", "24"]
    answer: "20"
    explanation: "The total sum is 20×5 = 100. The sum of the four known numbers is 18+22+16+24 = 80, so the fifth number is 100 − 80 = 20."

    options: ["0.7", "0.6", "0.9", "1.0"]
    answer: "0.7"
    explanation: "P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A∩B) = 0.5 + 0.4 − 0.2 = 0.7."

    options: ["15:24", "3:5", "5:8", "9:8"]
    answer: "5:8"
    explanation: "x:y = 3:4 ⇒ x:y = 15:20; y:z = 5:6 ⇒ y:z = 20:24; therefore x:z = 15:24 = 5:8."
