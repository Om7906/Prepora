# CAT 2025 – Modular Study Plans

## Overview
**AI-ready, modular study schedules** designed for dynamic adaptation based on student profile, timeline, and performance. Each plan includes daily/weekly structures, milestone tracking, and personalization scenarios.

---

## 1. One-Month Crash Plan

### Goal
Rapid revision, maximize accuracy and exam stamina for final push or last-minute joiners.

### Target Users
- **[Final Push]** All preparation levels in last month
- **[Last-Minute Joiners]** Basic foundation with intensive focus

### Daily Schedule (4-6 hours; modular to 2-3 hours for working professionals)

| Time | Activity | Notes | Personalization |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| 60 min | **Section 1** (rotate: QA/VARC/DILR) | Focus on weakest topic | [Beginner] Start with easiest section |
| 30 min | **Error log review & mini quiz** | Pick errors from previous mocks | [Advanced] Focus on silly mistakes only |
| 45 min | **Section 2** | Strongest area—speed and accuracy | [Intermediate] Mix difficulty levels |
| 15 min | **Formula/revision flashcards** | Quick review | [All Levels] Use spaced repetition |
| 60 min | **Section 3** | Moderate/"neglected" area | [Working Professional] Priority topics only |
| 30 min | **RC or DI timed drills** | Build endurance | [Advanced] Fast sets under pressure |
| 45 min | **Mock/test review or group study** | Alternate days | [Repeater] Focus on new mistake patterns |

### Weekly Schedule and Milestones

#### Mocks
- **Frequency:** 1 full-length mock every 3-4 days; 2 per week minimum
- **Analysis Time:** Equal to mock duration

#### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1:** Complete 50% of all key topics at least once
- **Week 2:** All sections revised once; attempt 2 past CAT papers
- **Week 3:** Focus shifts to repeated errors/mistake-prone areas
- **Week 4:** Final revision—stress management, sleep cycle, 2-3 mocks at real exam time

### Variations by Student Type

#### [Working Professionals]
- **Schedule:** 2-hour blocks (early morning/evening)
- **Focus:** More mocks and revision over deep-dives
- **Weekends:** Intensive 4-6 hour sessions

#### [College Students]
- **Schedule:** Use free afternoons/evenings
- **Pattern:** One section/day with extra mocks on weekends
- **Integration:** Blend with existing academic schedule

#### [Repeaters]
- **Priority:** Majority time on error log + weak topics
- **Approach:** Minimal time on strengths, intensive on gaps
- **Strategy:** Use previous year's performance data

## 5. Adaptation Guide

### Periodic Diagnostics
- **Take a full mock every 2-4 weeks** to realign plan to current strengths/weaknesses
- **[AI Integration]** Automatic plan adjustment based on performance trends

### Error Log Usage
- **After each mock/mistake:** Record error + cause + fix date
- **Review frequency:** Twice weekly
- **[Advanced]** Pattern recognition for recurring error types

### Section Weight Adjustment
- **Strong in QA:** Schedule more time for VARC or DILR
- **Weak in specific areas:** Dynamic time reallocation
- **[Personalization]** AI-driven daily schedule optimization

### Healthy Routines
- **Mandate:** One day off/week to avoid burnout
- **Track:** Sleep and meal habits, especially during final phases
- **[Crisis Management]** Automatic intervention protocols

---

## Personalization Scenarios

### By Current Performance Level
- **[Beginner]** Start with 6-month or 1-year plan, focus on foundation
- **[Intermediate]** 3-6 month plans with mock-heavy approach
- **[Advanced]** 1-3 month intensive with error minimization focus

### By Available Time
- **[<2 hours daily]** Adapt all plans to modular 45-60 min blocks
- **[2-4 hours daily]** Standard plan implementation
- **[>4 hours daily]** Accelerated timelines with additional practice

### By Weakness Patterns
- **[Scenario: Weak VARC + 6 months → Extra 30 min daily reading + RC practice]**
- **[Scenario: DILR struggles + 3 months → Daily puzzle practice + pattern recognition]**
- **[Scenario: QA conceptual gaps + 1 year → Foundation-heavy first quarter]**

### Emergency Adaptations
- **[Burnout detected]** Automatic plan scaling (50% reduction for 1 week)
- **[Performance plateau]** Strategy change recommendations
- **[Time constraint changes]** Dynamic schedule restructuring

## AI Implementation Notes

**All schedules are templates** for dynamic adaptation based on:
- Individual sleep/work/study preferences
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Stress level and motivation tracking
- Peer group integration opportunities
- Resource availability and preferences

**Encourage students to:**
- Routinely self-audit progress
- Swap section focus based on performance
- Use flexible study blocks
- Seek peer/mentor guidance for plan optimization
