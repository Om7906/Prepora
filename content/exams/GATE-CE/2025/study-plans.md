## 5. Adaptation Protocol (For AI Personalization)

### Dynamic Adjustment Triggers

#### After Each Mock
- **Identify top 3 error themes**â€”pivot next two days to those topics/types
- **Time management issues**â€”adjust daily practice schedule  
- **Subject weakness patterns**â€”reallocate weekly time distribution

#### Performance-Based Modifications
- **Strong topics:** Reduce theory time, focus on challenging PYQs/advanced NAT/MSQ
- **Weak areas:** Increase dedicated practice time, add conceptual review
- **Falling behind:** Skip extended notes on strengths; drill high-yield and error hotspots

#### Burnout Prevention
- **Early detection:** Monitor study hours, performance trends, and motivation levels
- **Intervention:** Mandate 1 rest day per week or 3 light days per month
- **Recovery:** Self-check on sleep, morale, and health regularly

#### Routine Optimization
- **Flexibility:** Shift session order, topic blocks, or daily timing based on energy
- **Life integration:** Adapt to class/job rhythm and external commitments  
- **Error-driven:** Use error log diagnostics for daily priority setting

### Subject-Specific Adaptations

#### Mathematics Weak
- **[Scenario: Poor Maths foundation â†’ Daily 45-min Maths drill + weekly concept review]**
- **Focus:** Linear algebra, calculus applications, probability basics
- **Resources:** NPTEL videos + targeted question banks

#### Structures Confusion  
- **[Scenario: SFD/BMD errors â†’ Daily diagram practice + 5 MCQs on analysis]**
- **Focus:** Fundamental analysis concepts, design code applications
- **Practice:** Hand-drawn diagrams, step-by-step calculations

#### Geotechnical Struggles
- **[Scenario: Soil mechanics weak â†’ 30-min daily on soil properties + bearing capacity]**
- **Focus:** Basic soil behavior, foundation design principles  
- **Tools:** Formula sheets, calculation practice

#### Environmental/Water Resources
- **[Scenario: Treatment process confusion â†’ Daily concept review + 3 MCQs]**
- **Focus:** Process flow diagrams, design calculations
- **Method:** Conceptual clarity before numerical practice

### Time Constraint Adaptations

#### Very Limited Time (<2 hours/day)
- **Priority:** High-yield topics only, PYQ focus, error log maintenance
- **Schedule:** Single focused session, weekend intensive
- **Resources:** Quick revision materials, mobile apps

#### Moderate Time (2-4 hours/day)  
- **Balance:** Theory + practice + regular assessment
- **Schedule:** Multiple focused sessions with breaks
- **Approach:** Systematic coverage with flexibility

#### Ample Time (>4 hours/day)
- **Comprehensive:** Full syllabus with deep practice
- **Schedule:** Multiple sessions with variety
- **Enhancement:** Advanced problems, peer teaching, extra mocks

## Emergency Protocols

### Performance Plateau
- **Detection:** No improvement in mock scores for 2+ weeks
- **Action:** Complete strategy review, subject reallocation, resource change
- **Duration:** 1-week strategy pivot, reassess after 3 sessions

### Burnout Detection
- **Signs:** Declining motivation, poor concentration, physical fatigue
- **Response:** Immediate 50% load reduction, focus on recovery
- **Recovery:** Light study, concept review only, social support

### Time Crunch
- **Trigger:** Unexpected reduction in available study time
- **Adaptation:** Immediate reprioritization to high-yield areas
- **Focus:** Error log + mocks + quick revision only

## AI Implementation Notes

All plans are intentionally **modular and adaptive**â€”subjects can be swapped or rescheduled based on:
- **Individual performance patterns** from mock analysis
- **Energy levels and external demands** (work/college schedule)
- **Error log diagnostics** and weak area identification  
- **Preparation timeline and available hours**

The framework enables the AI to:
- **Dynamically create** personalized daily schedules
- **Modify emphasis** based on student-specific performance data
- **Provide scenario-based guidance** for common preparation challenges
- **Track progress** against realistic milestones and adjust accordingly

**Key Personalization Factors:**
- Current preparation level and subject strengths/weaknesses
- Available daily study time and lifestyle constraints
- Learning style preferences and resource access
- Mock performance trends and error patterns
- Psychological factors (confidence, motivation, stress levels)
