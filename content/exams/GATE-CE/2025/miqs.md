    question: "A simply supported beam of span 6 m carries a uniform load of 4 kN/m. What is the maximum bending moment?"
    options: ["36 kN·m", "18 kN·m", "24 kN·m", "12 kN·m"]
    answer: "18 kN·m"
    explanation: "For a simply supported beam with a uniformly distributed load w over span L, the maximum bending moment is wL²/8 = 4×6²/8 = 18 kN·m."
