# 1. One-Month Crash Plan  
[Advanced][Repeater][Scenario: Last 30 Days Before Exam]

### 🎯 Main Objective:
- Maximize scoring potential  
- Strengthen high-yield chapters

|------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| W1   | NCERT Biology + Physics formula   | 2-part mocks + NCERT DPP | Cell, Thermo, Current, GOC, Genetics |
| W2   | Full-scope Chemistry + Physics PYQ| NEET PYQs only     | Laws of Motion, Biomolecules, Electrons |
| W3   | Mixed mini mocks + Spiral review | Past paper + new pattern | Coordination, Human Physiology       |

## AI Scenario Tags

- [Scenario: Weak in Physics + Avg in Bio] → Assign 5-day Physics-only loop (mock → error → formula → retest)  
- [Scenario: High burnout notice after 3 full mocks] → Switch to alternate-day schedule with Night revision-only days  
- [Scenario: Missed Week 3 due to illness] → Activate 10-Day Slow Spiral with only 3 subjects per week  
- [Scenario: Weekend exclusive prep] → Combine 2 half-mocks + 1 formula recap + 30Q biology sheet DPP
