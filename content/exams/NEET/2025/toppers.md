## 1. Priya – First-Attempt College Student (NEET AIR 312)

**Profile:** [Beginner][College Student]  
**Routine:**  
- 6:00–8:00 AM: Biology (NCERT, diagrams, 20 MCQs)  
- 9:00–1:00 PM: College classes  
- 2:00–3:30 PM: Chemistry (Physical/Organic, 15 numericals)  
- 5:00–6:30 PM: Physics (PYQs, 10 numericals)  
- 9:00–9:30 PM: Flashcard revision, error log update

**Challenges:**  
- Balancing college and NEET prep  
- Weak in Physics numericals

**Mistakes:**  
- Ignored error log for first 2 months  
- Delayed starting full-length mocks

**Fixes:**  
- Started daily error log review  
- Added 1 mock every Sunday, analyzed all errors  
- Focused on Physics NATs every morning

## 2. Arjun – Repeater (Drop Year, NEET AIR 189)

**Profile:** [Repeater][Intermediate]  
**Routine:**  
- 7:00–9:00 AM: Full mock (alternate days)  
- 10:00–11:30 AM: Error log correction, retry wrongs  
- 2:00–4:00 PM: Biology (NCERT + diagrams)  
- 5:00–6:30 PM: Chemistry (Red Zone topics)  
- 8:00–9:00 PM: Flashcards, formula recall

**Challenges:**  
- Burnout after 3 months of intense study  
- Kept repeating silly mistakes in Biology

**Mistakes:**  
- Tried to study 10+ hours/day, leading to fatigue  
- Ignored revision of error-prone topics

**Fixes:**  
- Switched to 6-hour focused days + 1 rest day/week  
- Created a “Red Zone” board for repeated errors  
- Weekly spiral revision of all error log topics

## 3. Meera – Working Student (Part-Time Job, NEET AIR 721)

**Profile:** [Working Student][Dropper]  
**Routine:**  
- Commute (1 hr): Audio lectures (Biology/NCERT)  
- 7:00–8:30 PM: Physics/Physical Chemistry numericals  
- 9:00–10:00 PM: Biology (MCQs, diagrams)  
- Saturday: 3-hr mock + error review  
- Sunday: Spiral revision, rest

**Challenges:**  
- Low energy after work  
- Missed study blocks due to job shifts

**Mistakes:**  
- Relied too much on passive video watching  
- Skipped error log review

**Fixes:**  
- Switched to “active recall” (writing, not just watching)  
- Kept a small error log notebook for daily review  
- Prioritized Biology and Chemistry on weekdays, Physics on weekends

## 4. Rohan – Consistency Struggler (NEET AIR 542, 2nd Attempt)

**Profile:** [Repeater][Intermediate]  
**Routine:**  
- 6:30–8:00 AM: Physics (mock section, 20 Qs)  
- 10:00–11:30 AM: Chemistry (NCERT + MCQs)  
- 3:00–4:30 PM: Biology (PYQs, diagrams)  
- 7:00–8:00 PM: Error log, formula recall  
- Sunday: Full mock, spiral revision

**Challenges:**  
- Lost motivation after every bad mock  
- Compared scores with friends, leading to stress

**Mistakes:**  
- Focused on strong topics, ignored weak areas  
- No fixed revision schedule

**Fixes:**  
- Made a “3-day bounce-back” plan: after a bad mock, only revise errors for 3 days  
- Rotated starting subject in every mock  
- Weekly “easy win” day to rebuild confidence

## 5. Sana – Biology-Strong, Physics-Weak (NEET AIR 201, College Student)

**Profile:** [College Student][Beginner]  
**Routine:**  
- 7:00–8:30 AM: Physics (NATs, formula writing)  
- 10:00–11:30 AM: Biology (NCERT, diagrams, 30 MCQs)  
- 4:00–5:30 PM: Chemistry (Physical/Organic, 20 numericals)  
- 8:00–9:00 PM: Error log, flashcards

**Challenges:**  
- Scared of Physics, avoided numericals  
- Over-relied on Biology for marks

**Mistakes:**  
- Skipped Physics in mocks  
- Did not analyze why she got Physics questions wrong

**Fixes:**  
- Started every day with Physics  
- Made a “Physics-only” error log  
- Practiced 10 Physics NATs daily, reviewed errors every 2 days

# Scenario-Based “If X is Weak, Do Y” Actions

### If Weak in Physics Numericals  
- Practice 10 NATs daily from weak chapters  
- Use error log to track calculation vs concept errors  
- Weekly: 1 Physics-only mock, review all errors

### If Consistency Drops After Bad Mock  
- Take 1–2 days for only error log and easy wins  
- Do not attempt new topics  
- Resume full routine after confidence returns

### If Biology Theory is Strong but MCQ Accuracy is Low  
- Do 20 MCQs after every theory session  
- Weekly: Redraw 10 diagrams from memory  
- Review error log every Sunday

### If Burnout or Fatigue Hits  
- Switch to 2-subject days for 48 hours  
- Take 1 full rest day per week  
- Focus on revision and error correction, not new content
