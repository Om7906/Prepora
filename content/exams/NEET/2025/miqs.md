# ✅ AI Usage Templates (If X is Weak, Do Y)

### If Weak In Physics Numericals  
→ Practice 10 NATs/day from Modern Physics + Circuit chapters  
→ Use “Physics Formula Spiral Sheet” every 48 hours  
→ Alternate between conceptual analysis and MCQ numericals

---

### If Organic Chemistry Reaction-Based Errors  
→ Memorize only key mechanisms: Aldol, Cannizzaro, Diels-Alder  
→ Create a mini reaction table: Reactant –> Reagent –> Product  
→ Solve 30 Predict-the-product type Qs in 1 week

---

### If Biology Theory Is Strong But Questions Go Wrong  
→ Begin recall drills with NCERT keywords  
→ Daily 15-question test: “Name the function” / “Location” / “Sequencing”  
→ Spiral revisit diagrams every Sunday

---

### If Losing Confidence After Mocks  
→ Don’t write long mocks for 3–5 days  
→ Instead, solve 4–5 small 15Q burst tests with lowest-scorer topic  
→ Shift to “Retry codebook” → record, reflect, redo until confidence resets
