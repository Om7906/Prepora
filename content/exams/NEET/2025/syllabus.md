## 5. Recent Trends & Pattern Changes

| Feature                         | Observation (2021–2024)                    | Recommendation                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Biology → 85-90% NCERT Line-Based| Direct lines often reused or reworded     | Read line-by-line + annotated notes |
| Physics → Slightly tougher       | Numerical-based + calculation focused      | Do timed 30Q NAT-only papers        |
| Chemistry → More Organic & Assertion | Conceptual not heavy mechanism required    | Strengthen NCERT + MTG Organic Series|

## 6. AI-Ready Use Cases – Examples

### [Scenario: Time management is weak → High Biology Strength]  
→ Focus 70% on Biology scoring via DPP + 3 mocks/week  
→ Assign Physics section tests AM and NAT-only tests Saturday

---

### [Scenario: Physics Concepts Weak, Chemistry Average]  
→ Redesign week as:  
  - Mon–Wed: Physics DPP + HCV Examples  
  - Thurs: Physical + Organic overlap  
  - Sunday: 2-section full mock + Retry Log Writing

---

### [Scenario: NCERT not done yet]  
→ Assign “45-day NCERT-only plan” + MTG line-based MCQ  
→ Mock allowed after Day 10 only (first 3 days = Reading only)
