## 1. Topper Story: Rohan (Rank 17, Repeater)

### Background
- Attempted GATE 2024 → AIR 987  
- Full-time preparation (drop year)  
- Strong in **Digital & Signals**, weak in **Electromagnetics**  

### Strategy & Routine
- **Daily Schedule (6–7 hrs)**:  
  1. 2 hrs Core theory (rotating Signals, Control, Digital)  
  2. 2 hrs Problem Solving (PYQs + mixed sets)  
  3. 1 hr Error Log review  
  4. 1.5 hrs Mock/Sectional test + Analysis
- **Key Decisions**:  
  - Dropped weak areas until Month 2, then revisited with focused practice  
  - Prioritized solving **last 10 years PYQs** twice

### Challenges & Fixes
- **Problem**: Weak EM concepts → scored poorly in mocks  
- **Solution**: Daily 30 min EM theory + 10 MCQs for 2 months  

### Outcome
- Achieved AIR 17 with 78 marks  
- 90% accuracy in strong areas, ~60% in EM after recovery

[Scenario: Repeater + Weak in EM → Follow Rohan’s EM recovery plan]

## 2. Topper Story: Priya (Rank 43, College Student)

### Background
- Final year B.Tech, limited prep time (~3 hrs/day weekdays)  
- Strong in **Control & Networks**, weak in **Analog Circuits**

### Study Approach
- **Weekdays**:  
  - 1 hr GA/Math  
  - 1 hr Core topic problem solving  
  - 1 hr Error Log + Formula review  
- **Weekends (6 hrs/day)**:  
  - 2 hrs Spiral revision  
  - 2 hrs PYQs  
  - 2 hrs Sectional mocks

### Mistakes & Recovery
- **Initial Mistake**: Focused only on strong topics for 2 months → mock scores plateaued  
- **Recovery**: Allocated 40% weekend time to Analog + EM with PYQs

### Tips
- Mini-mocks are better than full mocks early  
- Flashcards helped maintain formula retention

[Scenario: College Student + 3 hrs/day → Replicate Priya’s routine with weekend boosts]

## 3. Topper Story: Arjun (Rank 5, Working Professional)

### Background
- 9–5 job, 1.5 hrs weekday + 6 hrs weekend study  
- Strong in **Digital Circuits**; moderate in **Signals & Networks**

### Strategy
- **Weekday Micro Blocks**:  
  - 45 min Problem Solving (PYQs or error log)  
  - 30 min Theory or Formula Revision  
- **Weekend Heavy Blocks**:  
  - Saturday: 2 hrs Theory + 2 hrs Mock + 2 hrs Analysis  
  - Sunday: Spiral Revision + Error Log Review  

### Key Insights
- **Mock Analysis > New Topics** after 3rd month  
- **Time efficiency** critical → only high-yield topics in weekdays

[Scenario: Working Professional → Adopt Arjun’s weekday micro-block approach]

## 4. Common Scenarios & Personalized Guidance

### Scenario 1: Beginner, 6 Months Prep
- Focus: Math + GA + 2 Core Subjects first  
- Daily: 1 hr GA/Math + 2 hrs Core Theory + 1 hr Problems  
- [Beginner][Scenario: 6 Months → Prioritize Signals + Digital for scoring boost]

### Scenario 2: Repeater, 3 Months Crash
- Focus: Full mocks + error log-driven revision  
- Skip extremely low-weight topics if needed  
- [Repeater][Scenario: 3 Months → 2 mocks/week + 70% time on weak topics]

### Scenario 3: Working Professional, 4 Months
- 1.5 hrs weekday + 6 hrs weekend  
- Use commute/audio time for formula recap  
- [Working Professional][Scenario: 4 Months → Combine weekday micro-blocks + weekend mocks]

### Scenario 4: Advanced, 1-Year Plan
- Spiral revision from month 3  
- Start mocks by month 4  
- Maintain 2-page formula sheet for last month  
- [Advanced][Scenario: 1-Year → Weekly mock + immediate error log review]

## 5. Quick Reference Notes

- Toppers consistently:  
  1. Solve **10+ years PYQs** at least twice  
  2. Maintain **Error Log + Formula Sheet**  
  3. Switch to **mock-driven prep** in last 3 months
- [High-Yield] Early focus on Signals, Digital, and Control drives faster score gains
