## Sample Questions

1. **Signals** [Moderate][High-Yield]:  
   If x(t) = u(t) – u(t–1), find Fourier Transform of x(t).  
2. **Control Systems** [Easy]:  
   Determine the stability of a system with characteristic equation: s³ + 5s² + 6s + 0.  
3. **Digital Circuits** [Moderate]:  
   Design a 3-bit synchronous counter using JK flip-flops.  
4. **Electromagnetics** [Advanced]:

## Personalization Scenarios

- [Beginner] Focus on GA and Math first (scoring), then Signals + Networks  
- [Intermediate] Allocate 70% time to Core ECE, 30% to Math + GA  
- [Advanced] Full syllabus coverage; prioritize high-weightage problem-solving  
- [Working Professional] 1.5 hrs weekday, 5 hrs weekend; prioritize PYQs  
- [Scenario: Weak in Control Systems + 2 months left → 1 hr Control daily + 2 PYQs/session]

## Quick Reference Notes
- [High-Yield] Signals & Systems, Control, Digital Circuits  
- [Weak Area Focus] Electromagnetics and Analog Circuits need early attention  
- Solve at least 5 years of PYQs before mock tests
