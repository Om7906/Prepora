    question: "What is the time complexity of binary search on a sorted array of size n?"
    options: ["O(log n)","O(n)","O(n log n)","O(1)"]
    answer: "O(log n)"
    explanation: "Binary search repeatedly divides the search interval by two, leading to logarithmic complexity."

    question: "Which data structure is commonly used in an LRU cache to achieve O(1) access and update times?"
    options: ["HashMap and Doubly Linked List","Stack","Binary Search Tree","Queue"]
    answer: "HashMap and Doubly Linked List"
    explanation: "Combining a hash map for O(1) lookups with a doubly linked list for O(1) insert/delete allows efficient LRU cache implementation."

    question: "A relation is in which normal form if it has no partial dependency?"
    options: ["First Normal Form","Second Normal Form","Third Normal Form","Boyce-Codd Normal Form"]
    answer: "Second Normal Form"
    explanation: "Second Normal Form eliminates partial dependencies; all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key."
