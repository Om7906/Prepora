## Strategic AI Notes 🧠

### Error Log Protocol  
- **Daily**: Note and tag all errors (Conceptual/Calculation/Silly)  
- **Weekly Fixes**: 10 errors → 10 targeted problems  
- [AI Tip]: Track recurring error category; generate dynamic weak-topic playlists

### Mock Test Strategy  
- >3 Months: 1 full mock in 2 weeks  
- 1–3 Months: Weekly mock + topic tests  
- Final Month: 3 mocks/week  
[Scenario: Drop in mock score → Adjust plan around error log insights]

### Revision Protocol  
- Spiral-Based: Revise topic on Day 1 → again on Day 3 → Day 7 → Day 30  
- [High-Yield] Formula Flashcards per subject  
- [Working Professional] Apply Pomodoro + Weekender Batches
