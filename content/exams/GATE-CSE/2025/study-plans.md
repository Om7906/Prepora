# GATE Exam Modular Study Plans - AI Ready

## Overview
[Beginner][Intermediate][Advanced]  
[Working Professional][College Student][Repeater]  
Dynamic study frameworks for GATE aspirants with scenario-based personalization.  
[High-Yield] Focus on PYQs and weak area targeting in all plans.

---

## 1. 1-Month Crash Plan
### Objective
Rapid revision, exam simulation, and error minimization [Scenario: Last-minute prep → Prioritize high-yield topics]

### Daily Schedule (4-6 hrs/day)
| Time Slot | Activity | Personalization Tags |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| 6:30-8:00 AM | Core/Weakest Subject Focus | [Weak Area Focus][Scenario: Weak in Algorithms → CLRS Ch15-17] |
| 8:00-8:30 AM | Quick Revision | Previous day's notes & formulae |
| 10:00-11:00 AM | Practice Questions (Mixed/Sectional) | [High-Yield] Prioritize GATE PYQs |
| 11:15-12:00 PM | Secondary Subject | Alternate subjects daily |
| 2:00-2:30 PM | Mock Test/Timed Section | 30-min sprint for speed/accuracy |
| 8:00-8:30 PM | Error Log Review | Only repeated/wrong questions |

**Breaks**: 10-15 min every hour  
[Scenario: Burnout risk → Mandatory 5-min stretch every 90 min]

### Weekly Milestones
| Week | Focus | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation revision | Complete 3 high-yield subjects |
| 2 | Complex subjects | 50% PYQs solved with 70% accuracy |
| 3 | Full mock + weak areas | Identify top 3 error patterns |
| 4 | Final revision | 2-3 timed mocks >65% score |

**Mock Strategy**: 2-3 full-length timed tests weekly  
[Scenario: <50% in mock → Next day dedicated to weak topic]

### Profile Variations
- **[Working Professional]**: 2-2.5 hr blocks AM/PM  
  [Scenario: Limited time → Weekend mock analysis]
- **[College Student]**: Study around classes  
  [Scenario: Semester load → 1 mock/week minimum]
