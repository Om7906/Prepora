## 6. Use Cases for Personalized AI Strategy

### [Scenario: Weak in Organic Chemistry]  
- Suggested Books: NCERT + M.S. Chauhan  
- Suggested Plan: Daily 1 mechanism + 1 NCERT example  
- Test Sets: 20 PYQs from Carbonyl + GOC  
- Practice Tools: Named Reaction Cards, Spiral Formula Log

---

### [Scenario: Advanced Student Weak at Time Management]  
- Alternate-day full mocks at 9AM  
- Use Time per Section heat map  
- 3rd day → error reattempt + solve spiral tests from past 2 weeks errors

---

### [Scenario: Scoring Low Chemistry]  
- Assign NCERT-based paragraph questions  
- Use Chem mock from Vedantu/Unacademy DPP sheets  
- Target 100 equations in 4 weeks (acid-base, salts, electro)
