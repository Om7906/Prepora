    question: "A car moves with uniform acceleration from rest and covers 100 m in 5 seconds. What is its acceleration?"
    options: ["4 m/s^2","8 m/s^2","5 m/s^2","10 m/s^2"]
    answer: "8 m/s^2"
    explanation: "Using s = ut + (1/2)at^2 with u=0 gives 100 = 0 + 0.5 × a × 25, so a = 8 m/s²."

    question: "The derivative of x^3 with respect to x is:"
    options: ["3x^2","x^2","3x^3","2x"]
    answer: "3x^2"
    explanation: "Using the power rule d/dx x^n = n x^{n-1}. Here, n=3, so derivative is 3x²."

    question: "If sin θ = 1/2, what is cos θ in the first quadrant?"
    options: ["√3/2","1/2","√2/2","0"]
    answer: "√3/2"
    explanation: "In the first quadrant, sin θ = 1/2 implies θ = 30°, so cos θ = √3/2."
