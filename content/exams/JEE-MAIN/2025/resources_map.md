## 5. 📊 High-Yield Targeting Suggestions for the AI

> [Scenario: Weak in Organic Chemistry + 3 Months Left]  
- Book: NCERT + M.S. Chauhan  
- Video: Unacademy Reaction Mechanism Playlist  
- Practice: PW DPP Sheets – All Reactions + Named Sheets  
- Test: Embibe + Vedantu Chapter Tests + Solve past 3-year PYQs

> [Scenario: Strong in Physics MACROS, weak in Mechanics]  
- Use HC Verma + Wallah Rotational Drill + Full block on Work-Energy-Power  
- Test every 3rd day with 10 prior paper questions → log formulas missed

> [Scenario: Math scores unpredictable]  
- Spend 2 weeks on short mini-tests from Mathongo + past JEE shift papers  
- Use Mohit Tyagi Speed Sessions (Conditions, 3D, Complex Numbers)

## Use AI-Mentor to Deploy These

- ❓Low-score trend in Physics → Suggest filtered mock playlists (Rotation, EMI, Current)  
- ❓Repeater with formula fatigue → Recommend formula PDF decks + flash recall test  
- ❓Beginner can’t manage pace in Chemistry → Only NCERT + DPP, no advanced videos until mock 3
