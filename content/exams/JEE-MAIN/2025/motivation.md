## 6. Tips from Toppers (JEE Mains Specific)

> ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt score high because I knew more. I just forgot less, panicked less, and revised better.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúMock scores fluctuated. What kept me improving was fixing _why_ I lost marks ‚Äî even if I didn‚Äôt score higher that week.‚Äù

> ‚Äú2 formulas a day, 1 mistake reattempt, 1 concept to teach aloud. My every day was just that.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúOn burnout days, I did just 10 MCQs and 1 formula sheet. That made the next day possible.‚Äù
