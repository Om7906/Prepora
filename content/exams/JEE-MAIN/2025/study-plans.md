# JEE Mains – Modular Study Plans (1 Month to 1 Year)

## Overview  
[Beginner][Intermediate][Advanced]  
[College Student][Working Professional][Repeater]  
This file includes flexible but structured timelines based on user availability, student profile, and syllabus coverage. Each plan is built to support **strong core revision**, **weak zone recovery**, and **exam simulation** through **mock benchmarks & error analysis**.
