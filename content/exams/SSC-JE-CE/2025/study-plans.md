- **Follow the weekly/daily schedule**; adjust weak/strong subject focus as needed.
- **Log errors, track milestones, and adapt revision cycles** based on performance.
- **Use resource map and MIQ bank** for targeted practice.

## Modular Adaptation Tips
- **Weak Area Focus:** Allocate 40%+ of practice time to weakest 2 subjects; use MIQ bank and error log for targeted drills.
- **High-Yield First:** In crash/3-month plans, prioritize RCC, SOM, Fluids, Soil, Transportation.
- **Advanced Aspirant:** Increase mock frequency, focus on error taxonomy, and speed drills.
- **Burnout Guardrails:** 50–10 focus cycles, 1 rest evening/week, rotate subjects.

## Quick Reference

- **Error Log & Revision:**  
  - Log: Subject, Topic, Error type, Root cause, Fix, New example, Review dates  
  - Spaced repetition: D1–D3–D7–D14–D30; archive after 2 clean runs

- **High-Yield Topics:**  
  - RCC (IS 456 basics), SOM (Mohr/bending/columns), Fluids (manometry/pipe), Soil (Atterberg/permeability/consolidation/BC), Transportation (SSD/e), Surveying (curvature/tacheo), Environmental (BOD/filtration/sewer Manning)

- **Mock Frequency:**  
  - 1-month: 2–3 mocks/week  
  - 3-month: 1 sectional/week, 1 full mock/week (last month)  
  - 6-month: 1 sectional/2 weeks, 1 full mock/2 weeks (last 2 months)  
  - 1-year: 1 sectional/month (Q1–Q2), 1 full mock/month (Q3), 1 full mock/week (Q4)
