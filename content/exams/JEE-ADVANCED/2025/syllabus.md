|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Higher use of paragraph + comprehension in Chemistry | [Scenario: Requires stamina → Expose multi-Q parsing] |
| NATs dominate Physics numerical-heavy topics    | [Scenario: Weak in calculation → Touch numeric-only tests] |
| MSQs in Math increasingly involve conceptual multi-condition questions | [Scenario: Weak in concept tests → Push MSQ reboots]  |
| Graphical analysis rising in Physics & Calculus | [High-Yield: Create graph-based problem sets]        |
| Organic + Coordination compounds seen every year as reaction analysis tasks | [Repeat topic booster: Mech + Bonding drills]       |
