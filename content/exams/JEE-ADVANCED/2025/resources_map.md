# JEE Advanced 2025 – Comprehensive Resource Map
[Beginner] [Intermediate] [Advanced] [Repeater] [High-Yield] [Scenario: Resource Map for JEE Advanced]

---

## How to Use This Map
- **Pick one main resource per subject** (avoid resource overload).
- **Pair with PYQs and topic-wise tests** for best results.
- **Switch resources if you plateau for 7–10 days on a topic.**
- **Use the “If X is weak, do Y” scenarios at the end for dynamic, AI-driven recommendations.**

## Quick Reference

- **Error Log & Revision:**  
  - Log fields: Subject, Topic, Error type (Concept/Formula/Speed/Misread), Root cause, Fix, New example, Review dates  
  - Spaced repetition: D1–D3–D7–D14–D30; archive after 2 clean runs

- **High-Yield Summary:**  
  - Physics: Mechanics, E&M, Modern, Optics  
  - Chemistry: Physical (thermo, equilibrium), Organic (mechanisms), Inorganic (trends, NCERT)  
  - Maths: Algebra, Calculus, Coordinate, Vectors

- **Mock Frequency & Burnout:**  
  - 8–12 weeks: 1 sectional/week → 1 full mock/fortnight; final 4 weeks: 1 full mock/week  
  - Guardrails: 50–10 focus blocks; 1 rest evening/week; rotate subjects to avoid fatigue

## “If X is Weak, Do Y” Scenarios

- **If Physics is weak:**  
  - Do 20 PYQs daily, revise HCV every Friday, and watch 1 Physics Wallah marathon/weekend.
- **If Chemistry is weak:**  
  - 10 MCQs daily, focus on NCERT + O.P. Tandon, and take a weekly topic test.
- **If Maths is weak:**  
  - 15 Qs daily, maintain a formula sheet, and take a weekly full-length mock.
- **If you repeat silly mistakes:**  
  - Maintain a “Silly Mistake” list, review before every mock, and tag errors by type.
- **If time management is poor:**  
  - Simulate exam conditions for every mock, track time per section, and adjust attempt order.
