---

### Mentor Feedback Points (AI Use)

- [Failing to complete mock?] → Swap to 1 subject test + 10 retry Qs per error type  
- [Low scores in Calculus + Chemistry] → Propose 1 week Calc camp, next structure Chemical rotation  
- [Score not crossing 40% in mock] → Pull all past 30-day PYQs incorrectly attempted → Red-drill Series

---

# Final Tips for All Plans (AI Triggers)

### Red Zone = 3+ errors in same topic = High Priority  
→ Add it to visual log board  
→ Schedule retry sessions fortnightly

### Formula Deck  
- Build with top 3 formulas per chapter  
- Revise during idle time daily (public transport, meals, etc.)

### Spiral Revision  
Use 7–10–21 method:  
- 7 days → First revisit  
- 10 days later → Mini test  
- 21st day → Topic test + mistake memory check

---

# AI Tag Implementation

- [1-Month Sprint + Dropper] → Use crash plan + Red Zone master template  
- [Working Professional + 6 Months Left] → Night sessions + weekend mock/YYYY  
- [Beginner College Student + 1 Year] → Q1 = Core concepts only, no mocks  
- [Repeater] → Track exact mocks where you failed decisions (not only accuracy)
