- **Post-mock:** 1-hour analysis session to target error clusters
- **[Advanced]** Include MSQ/NAT heavy mocks for real exam simulation

### Revision Cycles
- **Alternate days:** Quick-fire summary of previous errors + mind-map creation
- **Each Sunday:** Complete "error log" check + 1 past paper (timed)
- **[Beginner]** Focus more on formula recall, less on complex analysis

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1:** All core subjects reviewed once; high/weak topics listed
- **Week 2:** First full-length mock reviewed in-depth
- **Week 3:** Focus shifts from theory to daily timed practice
- **Week 4:** Final week—simulate exam conditions, focus on stress/recovery management

### Adaptations by Student Type

#### [Working Professionals]
- **Schedule:** Modular 2×2.5 hour blocks (AM/PM); focus on error review/mocks
- **Strategy:** Use commute time for formula audio review
- **Priority:** High-yield topics over comprehensive coverage

#### [College Students]
- **Schedule:** Use breaks for mocks; alternate full-topic days with lighter practice
- **Integration:** Align intensive sessions with lighter academic days
- **Social:** Leverage peer groups for quick doubt resolution

#### [Repeaters]
- **Focus:** Emphasis on only weak areas + all previous error logs; no time on strong topics

## 5. Modular Adaptation Protocol

### Dynamic Adjustment Triggers

#### After Each Mock
- **Log top 5 errors:** Next 1-2 days focus on similar Qs for improvement
- **Time management issues:** Adjust daily practice schedule and question selection
- **Subject weakness patterns:** Reallocate weekly time distribution

#### Subject Strength-Based Adaptation
- **Strong in Thermal:** Allocate more "core Q" hours to Manufacturing or SOM (and vice versa)
- **Weak in specific areas:** Increase dedicated practice time, add conceptual review
- **[Scenario: Mathematics weak → Daily 45-min Math drill + weekly concept review]**

#### Special Circumstances
- **Falling behind:** Compress core topics and shift hours to high-yield Q practice + error logs
- **Ahead of schedule:** Introduce advanced problems and mixed-topic challenges
- **Burnout signs:** Immediate load reduction and recovery protocols

### Burnout Prevention Protocol
- **Always provide:** 1-2 rest days per 14 days
- **Focus on:** Revise not just for knowledge but for stamina and stress management
- **Recovery activities:** Light exercise, proper sleep, social interaction
- **[Working Professional]** Mandatory rest during high work-stress periods

### Performance-Based Modifications

#### Strong Performance (>70% mock scores)
- **Reduce:** Basic theory time
- **Increase:** Advanced problems and mixed-topic questions
- **Focus:** Perfecting time management and avoiding silly mistakes

#### Moderate Performance (50-70% mock scores)
- **Balance:** Theory consolidation with targeted practice
- **Focus:** Error log analysis and weak area improvement
- **Strategy:** Consistent improvement trajectory

#### Weak Performance (<50% mock scores)
- **Increase:** Foundation review and basic problem practice
- **Focus:** Concept clarity before attempting complex problems
- **Strategy:** Build confidence through achievable targets

## 6. Emergency Protocols

### Performance Plateau
- **Detection:** No improvement in mock scores for 2+ weeks
- **Action:** Complete strategy review, subject reallocation, resource change
- **Duration:** 1-week strategy pivot, reassess after 3 sessions

### Time Crunch (Unexpected Reduction)
- **Trigger:** Unexpected reduction in available study time
- **Adaptation:** Immediate reprioritization to high-yield areas only
- **Focus:** Error log + mocks + quick revision, skip comprehensive theory

### Confidence Crisis
- **Signs:** Persistent low mock scores, demotivation, anxiety
- **Response:** Return to basics, achievable daily targets, positive reinforcement
- **Recovery:** Light study with success-building exercises
